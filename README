a graphing post processor for spice files
GPL v2.0

This version defaults to use the pdplot(1) program for plotting.

Gnuplot(1) can be used instead by specifying the -g option.  However, 
no further development with gnuplot is anticipated.  It doesn't behave
nicely on my system (grabbing the focus and relocating the window after
each plot), so pdplot(1) is preferred.  Eventually, I plan to integrate
the plotting engine into the same source as post to avoid the slow
transmission of large data sets between separate programs using pipes. 
Some preliminary experiments show that 10x speedups are possible by
plotting only visible pixels and not sending the complete dataset to the
plotter. 

In either case, you will need to install your graphing program of
choice. 

See the HELP file for some useful comments.
